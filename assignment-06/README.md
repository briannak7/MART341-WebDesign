**The difference between semantic and structural markup.**

*Semantic markup:* conveys specific properties or meaning to the elements of the website (such as to a title by italicizing it). Bold, quotes, and strikethroughs are a few examples.

*Structural markup:* embeds information about the document's structure. Headings and paragraphs are examples.

### How browsers function:

Browsers have a UI that details certain items, such as a webpage's address, a back and forward button, a refresh button, and more! They send a request to a server over the network which responds with web content (HTML, CSS, JS, and other files). This content is then rendered in your browser with your browser's rendering engine. Different browsers can have different rendering engines and thus some pages will construct a page slightly different than others. This is why it's important to test your web page on many different browser types *and* different systems (mobile vs pc). Browsers also have their own javascript interpreters to interpret the javascrpt elements within a page. This allows certain portions (objects) of the webpage to be interactive (perhaps a loading progress bar).

### The browsers I use:

For the most part I use Google Chrome as it's convienent. While it does eat up a lot of my RAM, this isn't a huge issue so long as I don't keep an absurd number of tabs open. I have used Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and other browsers when needed. If I'm testing a web page I'll test it on Google Chrome before testing on other browsers.

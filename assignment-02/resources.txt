What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
	A directory is a file path containing of folders. These are heirarchical 
	and must be accessed as such. In Windows, directory names are not case
	sensitive. Directories contain files of various types; text, image, music, 
	html, scripts, and more.

How are VCS useful?
	Version control is very helpful as it can allow for collaboration on projects
	with a group/team. Furthermore, if a teammate pushes and merges code that
	breaks the previous main/master code, git and many other version controls 
	allow users to revert back to the working code (or any other previous version). 

Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?
	I don't have a favorite artistic medium. All art has the potential 
	to be unique or very dull regardless of the medium at hand.

What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?
	An IP address is like your home address or a website's "home" address. All devices have different IP addresses and different portions of the IP address stand for the object/site's country/network, region/network, subnetwork, and device. 
	The DNS, or Domain Name Service, associates sites with IP addressses. It translates the domain name to the IP address. It's like the "name" of the address where the IP address is the "physical" address.

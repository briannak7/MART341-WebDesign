### Markdown

I have learned what the different parts of a URL are. The **protocol**, **domain**, and the **path**. I understand how they work, but knowing the naming convention will likely come in handy. 

I have learned how to make items **bold** or *itallic* in markdown files, along with how to initiate a new line, and more!

Lastly, I have learned that the internet was initially created to survive a nuclear explosion in the 70s.

    <h1><br>About me</h1>

    <hr /><br>

    <p>
        From my experiences as a student at the University of Montana with a major in Computer Science, 
        I have come to love data and the stories it can tell us. Soon after this discovery I acquired 
        a Data Science Assistant position on campus through Montana Campus Compact. I am continually 
        growing, facing new challenges, and rediscovering why I wanted to major in computer science to 
        begin with.
    </p>

    <p>
        I expect to graduate with my degree in the Spring of 2024.

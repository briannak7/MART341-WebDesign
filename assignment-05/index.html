    <h1><br>Hello, my  name is Brianna Daniels</h1>

    <hl /><br>
    
    <p>
        I would like to add interaction, color, and animation to this site. At current,
        I feel I have a skeletal structure of my ideal portfolio started. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I would also like to add a functional navbar for the different pages. 
        <br />
        Adding appropriate images (such as to my projects in an appropriate page) would be a good idea, as well.

        Here's a photo of Montana.

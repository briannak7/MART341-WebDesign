**Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine.**
**What year was it from?**
**How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?**

I visited the old version of Youtube from the years 2005 to about 2015.
I did this as I remember how it used to look when the site first came out and slowly changed over the years. 
Today, the site is very modern looking, and while I do like it, I do have nostolgia from before. 
Much of the functions of Youtube today is easier to understand quickly, and user pages are less of social media and more about showing the videos.

**What is an affordance?**

An affordance is roles or function a web object (div/button/etc) has. An example could be a speaker image to tell the site user they can mute or unmute by pressing. A login button that says "login" rather than left blank is another great use of affordance that's commonly accepted. 

**What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a third-party service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos?**

The advantages are that there are a *ton* of videos to choose from, and the embed link is given to you with a few clicks. Unfortuantetly, not all videos are copyright free or royalty free. This means you may have to pay a price to use someone's video or face potential legal action. 

**Optional: What challenges did you face this week with this assignment? How did you overcome them?**

I struggled with getting the videos on the page. I forgot that YouTube has the option to embed once share is clicked. The video's I used within my own directory was difficult as I didn't realise the period was needed before the source url. This is something very interesting and helpful I will never forget (hopefully). For these, I went through the class website again and refreshed some key parts I didn't retain as well.

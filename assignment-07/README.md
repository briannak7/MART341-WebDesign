I'm not sure if this is the same kind of form, but I work with a lot of Qualtrics based forms/surveys. They can serve many purposes, but I utilize these surveys to gather data.

Other forms I've noticed before are forms to upload images. I made a website last semester that focused on using a python framework rather than HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and my 
group created a form for users to upload images, along with a "chat" function which worked more like a public posting than a DM or comment. 

I also am quite familiar with the forms on Moodle to upload files, text, take exams or quizzes, discuss with classmates, and more!
